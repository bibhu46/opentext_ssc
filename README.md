To implement the TaskExecutor service according to the given specifications, we need to fulfill a few requirements and constraints:

Key Requirements and Assumptions:
Concurrent Task Submission: The service should handle multiple task submissions without blocking the submitter.
Asynchronous and Concurrent Execution: Tasks should run concurrently but respect a maximum concurrency restriction. However, the maximum concurrency is not explicitly defined in the problem, so I'll assume a default value (like 4). If needed, you can extend this functionality later.
Order Preservation: The order of task execution should be preserved as per the submission order. We will use a queue for managing this task order.
Task Group Synchronization: Tasks in the same TaskGroup should not run concurrently. This suggests a need for synchronization when submitting tasks from the same group.
Java 17+: The code should run with OpenJDK 17 and not use any third-party libraries.
No Modifications to Provided Classes: The provided Task, TaskGroup, TaskType, and TaskExecutor interface should remain unchanged.
Given these requirements, the implementation will likely involve:

A thread pool for executing tasks concurrently.
A queue for ensuring task order.
A mechanism for synchronizing tasks within the same TaskGroup.
Let's break down the solution and implementation:

Implementation Outline:
Task Queue: We'll use a ConcurrentLinkedQueue to maintain the order of task submissions.
Task Group Synchronization: We can use a Map<TaskGroup, Object> to store synchronization objects (locks) for each group. Tasks within the same group will synchronize on their respective lock.
Thread Pool: We'll use an ExecutorService to manage the task execution.
Future Handling: Each submitted task will return a Future that allows the submitter to retrieve the result once the task completes.

Explanation:
ExecutorService:
We use a FixedThreadPool with a maximum concurrency level. This ensures that no more than maxConcurrency tasks are running concurrently.

Task Queue:
We use a LinkedList to maintain the tasks in the order they were submitted.
Tasks are processed one by one in the order of submission. We pull tasks from the queue and submit them for execution asynchronously.

Synchronization on Task Groups:
A Map<TaskGroup, Object> is used to store an Object (acting as a lock) for each task group.
When a task from a specific TaskGroup is submitted, it acquires the lock for that group, ensuring that tasks within the same group are executed sequentially.

Task Execution:
When a task is executed, the task's Callable is invoked, and the result is captured in the future (CompletableFuture).
After completion, we check if there are any remaining tasks and continue executing them.

Task Future:
The task is wrapped with a CompletableFuture which allows it to signal completion and return results asynchronously.

Assumptions:
The maximum concurrency is assumed to be defined by the maxConcurrency parameter in the constructor.
The code assumes that submitTask calls are from different threads, so proper synchronization is done on the group lock.
